## 🚀 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of a sample e-commerce dataset inspired by Meesho. The goal is to extract actionable business intelligence by examining key areas: **sales performance**, **customer behavior**, and **operational efficiency**. By leveraging Python, SQL, and data visualization, this analysis uncovers insights that can help drive strategic decisions, optimize processes, and enhance customer loyalty.

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of end-to-end data analysis, from data loading and processing to generating insights and visualizations.

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

The project is structured around three core business intelligence modules:

### 1. Sales Performance Analysis
-   **Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) Calculation**: Identified top-performing products by calculating the total sales value generated by each item. This insight is crucial for inventory management, marketing focus, and catalog optimization.
-   **Order Volume vs. Product Price Visualization**: Analyzed the relationship between how many times a product is ordered and its price point. This helps in understanding price elasticity and identifying high-volume products that may be candidates for strategic price adjustments or promotions.

### 2. Customer Behavior Analysis
-   **Weekly Retention Cohort Analysis**: Developed a retention model to track cohorts of new users week-over-week. This analysis measures customer loyalty and the platform's ability to retain its user base over time, which is a key indicator of product health and customer satisfaction. The output provides a clear view of how many customers from a specific signup week return for subsequent purchases.

### 3. Operational Efficiency Analysis
-   **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) Shipping Performance**: Evaluated the efficiency of the shipping and dispatch process by comparing the promised dispatch date against the actual dispatch date.
-   **Shipment Delay Categorization**: Orders were categorized into "On-Time," "1 Day Late," "2 Days Late," and ">2 Days Late." This granular analysis helps identify potential bottlenecks in the supply chain and provides data-driven feedback for improving logistics and meeting customer expectations.

## ⚙️ How to Run This Project

To replicate this analysis, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
-   A Google Account (for Google Drive and Colab).

### Setup
1.  **Get the Files**: Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Upload Data to Google Drive**:
    -   Go to your Google Drive and create a new folder named `meesho`.
    -   Upload all the `.csv` files from the `data` directory of this project into the `meesho` folder.
3.  **Open in Colab**: Upload the `Meesho_Analysis.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.

### Execution
1.  **Mount Your Drive**: Run the first code cell in the notebook. This will prompt you to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive. Follow the on-screen instructions.
2.  **Run the Analysis**: Once your drive is mounted, you can run all the remaining cells (**`Runtime`** -> **`Run all`**) to execute the full analysis pipeline. The results, tables, and plots will be displayed inline in the notebook.
